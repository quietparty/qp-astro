wip from op-1 of a track with some nice words.

i was listening to an old kaleidoscope record from 1967 and the alternating
flams on the snare drum were striking me in the belly. i tried programming that
kinda sound in at 32nds on the `ENDLESS` sequencer. it really **was something**,
immediamente. the whole song came together pretty quick after that.

the vocal was recorded on the little iRig Pre√§mp direct into the OP-1. i did it
at zaina's house while she was out for her morning run.

everything recorded into the op-1, and this track directly off it. real
`side_a.wav` heads know.
